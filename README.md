# cs334_machine_learning
This repository contains the final project for Emory Fall 2020 CS334 Machine Learning class taught by Professor Li. Xiong.
Contains jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, logistic regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and neural network
Also contain a python file for implementing Decision Tree and Random Forest models.

The project report is uploaded as well, describing our procedure as well as reasons for choosing these machine learning models.
